== Doing

* Implement decompressing compressed columns in the doc op format

== Cleanups
* Make a `ParseInput` which allows parsing logic to access the position in a
  parse stream and also to parse from a `Cow<'a, [u8]>`
* Sort out `parse` errors
* Rename `ColumnMetadata` to `RawColumns`
* Rename `ColumnLayout` to `Columns`
* Make all decoders fallible
* `try_splice` on all encoders
* Add a "compressed" flag to all the basic ranges which causes their iterator
  to first decompress the data
* Make DecodeColumnError easier to work with by adding some kind of "column path"
* Change `ColumnLayoutParser` to use `RawColumn` rather than two arguments of
  `ColumnSpec` + `Range<usize>`

* Replace every use of `usize` as a lookup with a newtype wrapper
* Replace the `Vec<usize>` returned by `IndexedCache::encode_index` with a specific type
