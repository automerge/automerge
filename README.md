Automerge is a library which provides fast implementations of several different
CRDTs, a compact compression format for these CRDTs, and a sync protocol for
efficiently transmitting those changes over the network. The objective of the
project is to support [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) applications in the same way that relational
databases support server applications - by providing mechanisms for persistence
which allow application developers to avoid thinking about hard distributed
computing problems. Automerge aims to be PostgreSQL for your local-first app.

On our website you'll find [documentation for JavaScript](https://automerge.org/docs/hello/),
complete with tutorials and an API reference.
This repository also contains the core Rust library which is compiled to WebAssembly and exposed in JavaScript,
the docs for which can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/automerge/latest/automerge/).
Finally, there is a C library in `rust/automerge-c` — take a look at the README there for more details.

If you're familiar with CRDTs and interested in the design of Automerge in
particular take a look at [the binary format spec](https://automerge.org/automerge-binary-format-spec).

## Status

This project is formed of a core Rust implementation which is exposed via FFI in
javascript+WASM, C, and soon other languages. Alex
([@alexjg](https://github.com/alexjg/)) and Orion
([@orionz](https://github.com/orionz)) are working full time on maintaining
automerge, other members of Ink & Switch are also contributing time and there
are several other maintainers. We recently released [Automerge 3](https://automerge.org/blog/automerge-3/)
which achieved around a 10x reduction in memory usage.

In general we try and respect semver.

### JavaScript

A stable release of the javascript package is available as `@automerge/automerge`.

### Rust

The rust codebase is currently oriented around producing a performant backend
for the Javascript wrapper and as such the API for Rust code is low level and
not well documented. We will be returning to this over the next few months but
for now you will need to be comfortable reading the tests and asking questions
to figure out how to use it. If you are looking to build rust applications which
use automerge you may want to look into
[autosurgeon](https://github.com/automerge/autosurgeon).

## Repository Organisation

- `./rust` - the rust implementation and also the Rust components of
  platform specific wrappers (e.g. `automerge-wasm` for the WASM API or
  `automerge-c` for the C FFI bindings)
- `./javascript` - The javascript library which uses `automerge-wasm`
  internally but presents a more idiomatic javascript interface
- `./scripts` - scripts which are useful to maintenance of the repository.
  This includes the scripts which are run in CI.
- `./img` - static assets for use in `.md` files

## Building

To build this codebase you will need:

- `rust`
- `node`
- `yarn`

And if you are interested in building the automerge-c library

- `cmake`
- `cmocka`
- `doxygen`
- `ninja`

You will also need to install the following with `cargo install`

- `wasm-bindgen-cli`
- `wasm-opt`
- `cargo-deny`

And ensure you have added the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target for rust cross-compilation.

The various subprojects (the rust code, the wrapper projects) have their own
build instructions, but to run the tests that will be run in CI you can run
`./scripts/ci/run`.

### For macOS

These instructions worked to build locally on macOS 13.1 (arm64) as of
Nov 29th 2022.

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/automerge/automerge
cd automerge

# install rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# install cmake, node, cmocka
brew install cmake node cmocka

# install yarn
npm install --global yarn

# install javascript dependencies
yarn --cwd ./javascript

# install rust dependencies
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli wasm-opt cargo-deny

# get nightly rust to produce optimized automerge-c builds
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly

# add wasm target in addition to current architecture
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Run ci script
./scripts/ci/run
```

If your build fails to find `cmocka.h` you may need to teach it about homebrew's
installation location:

```
export CPATH=/opt/homebrew/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
./scripts/ci/run
```

## Nix Flake

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed, there is a flake available with all
of the dependencies configured and some helper scripts.

``` console
$ nix develop

## Contributing

Please try and split your changes up into relatively independent commits which
change one subsystem at a time and add good commit messages which describe what
the change is and why you're making it (err on the side of longer commit
messages). `git blame` should give future maintainers a good idea of why
something is the way it is.

### Releasing

There are four artefacts in this repository which need releasing:

* The `@automerge/automerge` NPM package
* The `@automerge/automerge-wasm` NPM package
* The automerge deno crate
* The `automerge` rust crate

#### JS Packages

The NPM package is released automatically by CI tooling whenever a new Github release
is created. This means that the process for releasing a new JS version is:

1. Bump the version in `@automerge/automerge` also in `javascript/package.json`
2. Put in a PR to main with the version bump, wait for tests to run and merge to `main`
3. Once merged to main, create a tag of the form `js/automerge-<version>`
4. Create a new release on Github referring to the tag in question

This does depend on an access token available as `NPM_TOKEN` in the
actions environment, this token is generated with a 30 day expiry date so needs
(manually) refreshing every so often.

#### Rust Package

This is much easier, but less automatic. The steps to release are:

1. Bump the version in `automerge/Cargo.toml`
2. Push a PR and merge once clean
3. Tag the release as `rust/automerge@<version>`
4. Push the tag to the repository
5. Publish the release with `cargo publish`
