# Automerge Experiment

### Setup

You will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), [rust](https://rustup.rs/) and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) installed.

To build and test the rust library:

```shell
  $ cd automerge
  $ cargo test
```

To build and test the wasm library:

```shell
  ## setup
  $ cd automerge-wasm
  $ yarn

  ## building or testing
  $ yarn build
  $ yarn test

  ## without this the js library wont automatically use changes
  $ yarn link

  ## cutting a release or doing benchmarking
  $ yarn release
  $ yarn opt ## or set `wasm-opt = false` in Cargo.toml on supported platforms (not arm64 osx)
```

And finally to test the js library. This is where most of the tests reside.

```shell
  ## setup
  $ cd automerge-js
  $ yarn
  $ yarn link "automerge-wasm"

  ## testing
  $ yarn test
```

## Benchmarking

The `edit-trace` folder has the main code for running the edit trace benchmarking.
