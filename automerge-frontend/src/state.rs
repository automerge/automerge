/// Tracks the possible states of the frontend
///
/// What does this mean and why do we need it? The reason the frontend/backend
/// split exists in the first place is that we want to quickly apply local
/// changes (local in this sense means something like "on the UI thread") on a
/// low latency local cache whilst also shipping those same changes off to a
/// backend, which can reconcile them with historical changes and new changes
/// received over the network - work which may be more compute intensive and
/// so have to high a latency to be acceptable on the UI thread.
///
/// This frontend/backend split implies that we need to optimistically apply
/// local changes somehow. In order to do this we immediately apply changes to
/// a copy of the local state (state being an instance of [StateTree]) and
/// add the sequence number of the new change to a list of in flight requests.
/// In detail the logic looks like this:
///
/// When we receive a patch from the backend:
/// 1. Check that if the patch is for our actor ID then the sequence number of
///    the patch is the same as the sequence number of the oldest in flight
///    request.
/// 2. Apply the patch to the `reconciled_state` of the current state
/// 3. If there are no in flight requests remaining then transition from
///    the `WaitingForInFlightRequests` state to the `Reconciled` state,
///    moving the `reconciled_state` into the `Reconciled` enum branch
