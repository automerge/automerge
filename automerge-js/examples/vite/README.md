# Vite + Automerge

There are three things you need to do to get WASM packaging working with vite:

1. Install the top level await plugin
2. Install the `vite-plugin-wasm` plugin
3. Exclude `automerge-wasm` from the optimizer

First, install the packages we need:
```bash
yarn add vite-plugin-top-level-await
yarn add vite-plugin-wasm
```

In `vite.config.js`

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import wasm from "vite-plugin-wasm"
import topLevelAwait from "vite-plugin-top-level-await"

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [topLevelAwait(), wasm()],

    optimizeDeps: {
        // This is necessary because otherwise `vite dev` includes two separate
        // versions of the JS wrapper. This causes problems because the JS
        // wrapper has a module level variable to track JS side heap
        // allocations, initializing this twice causes horrible breakage
        exclude: ["automerge-wasm"]
    }
})
```

Now start the dev server:

```bash
yarn vite
```

## Running the example

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
