# Binary Document Format

The binary format of an automerge document compresses the changes into a compact column-oriented representation.
This makes the format very suitable for storing durably due to its compact size.

## Format

| Field                   | Byte Length     | Description                                          |

| Checksum                | 4               | First 4 bytes of the SHA256 of the encoded chunk     |

## Change information

Changes are encoded in causal order (a topological sort of the hash graph).

The change information contains the column ids that are present in the encoding.
Empty columns (those with no data) are not included.

For each included column the following is encoded:

| Field       | Byte Length     | Description                               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Column ID   | Variable (uLEB) | The ID of the column this data represents |
| Data length | Variable (uLEB) | The length of the data in this column     |

See [Change columns](.#change-columns) for the columns that may be included here.

## Change bytes

For each change we encode its information in the following columns (note the absence of operations which are encoded separately):

| Column     | Type of Data                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actor      | Position of the actor in the sorted actors list                 |
| Seq        | Value of the sequence counter for this change                   |
| Max Op     | The maximum sequence number of the operations in this change    |
| Time       | The timestamp this change was produced at                       |
| Message    | The message this change came with                               |
| Deps num   | The number of dependencies this change has                      |
| Deps index | The indices of the dependencies, as they appear in the document |
| Extra len  | Length of the extra bytes                                       |
| Extra raw  | The raw extra bytes                                             |

## Operations information

Operations are extracted from changes and grouped by the object that they manipulate.
Objects are then sorted by their IDs to make them appear in causal order too.

The operations informatino contains the column ids that are present in the encoding.
Empty columns (those with no data) are not included.

For each included column the following is encoded:

| Field       | Byte Length     | Description                               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Column ID   | Variable (uLEB) | The ID of the column this data represents |
| Data length | Variable (uLEB) | The length of the data in this column     |

See [Operations columns](.#operations-columns) for the columns that may be included here.

## Operations bytes

For each expanded operation we encode its information in the following columns:

| Column            | Type of Data                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpID Actor        | Position of the actor part of the OpID in the sorted actor list  |
| OpID Counter      | The counter part of this OpID                                    |
| Insert            | Whether this operation is an insert or not                       |
| Action            | Action type that this operation performs                         |
| Object ID actor   | The actor part of the object this operation manipulates          |
| Object ID counter | The counter part of the object this operation manipulates        |
| Key actor         | The actor part of this key (if a sequence index)                 |
| Key counter       | The counter part of this key (if a sequence index)               |
| Key string        | The string part of this key (if a map key)                       |
| Value ref counter | The counter part of the OpID this cursor refers to (cursor only) |

| Value raw         | The actual value                                                 |
| Successors number | The number of successors in this operation                       |
| Successor actor   | The actor part of the successor                                  |
| Successor counter | The counter part of the successor                                |

## Encodings

### uLEB

uLEB is an unsigned [little endian base 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) value.
This is a variable length encoding to keep things compact when values are small.

### RLE

Run length encoding of raw values.

### Delta

Deltas between values are rle encoded.

### Boolean

Encodes the count of the same value with counts alternating false and true.
