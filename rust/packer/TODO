Cleanup
* ScanMeta should be a lambda

* Delta needs a different primitive `Delta { abs: i64, step: i64 }`
  * this will allow for cleanup/removal of all the special case abs code in writer etc

* Need to have distinct cursors for Rle<u64>, Rle<Option<u64>>, Rle<String>, Rle<Vec<u8>>
  * maybe get_ref(), iter_ref() for things that implement Borrow()
  * would be nice to get rid of all the Cow's

* need more methods to make these behave like Vec such as col[a..b] as a stand-in for
  col.iter_range(a..b)

* need to normalize all the min/max stuff - not needed for all slabs and taking up space

* would be nice to have a stat_collector for iter()/get()
