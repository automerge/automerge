Cleanup
* can I move ColExport entirely into a test block?
* rename ColumnData - as a general purpose compression crate these aren't necessarily columns
* ScanMeta should be a trait not a struct
* Packable trait probably needs to be 2 traits - note: bool cursor panics on unpack()
* Packable and WriteOp can likely be integrated logically
